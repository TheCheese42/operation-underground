# Operation Underground

After Humans and Monsters lived together in harmony, the Monsters managed to win a game of Rock Paper Scissors and sealed the Humans Underground with a magic Spell. There's only one Problem: The Spell requires huge amounts of Stone!

Solve Puzzles and collect Energy Potions in order to blow up the required Stone needed to renew the Barrier.

Operation Underground was created within 3 days for the Mini Jam #179 with the Theme "Energy" and the Limitation "Creation through destruction".
